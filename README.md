# Climate Destroyer VR

Our final project for ICS691 (Virtual/Augmented Reality) is game which allows the player to perform the unethical actions of harming the environment without risk of punishment. The environment changes dynamically in coresspondence to the amount of pollution coming from the player and they can unlock more items as they obtain points through throwing more waste.

## Types of Waste (in order of unlock)
1. Plastic water bottles (given at start)
2. Samsung Galaxy Note 7's
3. Spray cans
4. Oil
5. Fire
